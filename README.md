### Description

This mod allows you to choose which blocks with connected textures will be enabled in your pack. For example, if you
have a connected textures pack, but you don't want the log textures to be connected, then you can simply disable only
these textures, while keeping the other textures connected

üèõÔ∏è In order to work, this mod needs 3 things (for links, you can click the badges above) :

- The Fabric or Quilt API
- A connected textures mod like Continuity or Optifine
- A CTM capable resource pack (basically a resource pack that adds connected textures)

For the resource packs to be detected, they simply have to be in your usual resourcepacks folder

Once you have installed the mods and resource pack(s), you have to select in Minecraft the resource packs you want (you
just need to activate the resource pack like in vanilla). Then you can go in the config screen of the mod using the U
key or ModMenu, and you will have access to all the options

### üí≤`Features`

1. Choose which blocks will have connected textures among the possible ones *(‚ùó if your pack is a zip file, the
   resources will reload 2 times when enabling or disabling textures, this is normal. It is because zip files can't be
   modified while used by Minecraft, so we the mod unloads the pack, modifies it and reloads it)*
2. Choose which group of block will connect (ex: all logs or all metals)
