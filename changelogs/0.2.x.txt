0.2.0 :
    ðŸ«§ Changed :

    - The resource pack screen (the one where you can select the blocks)
      have been remade using code from the Vwoops mod made by dicedpixels
      (https://modrinth.com/mod/vwoops). I then adapted this code to my needs

0.2.2 :
    ðŸŒˆ Changed :

    - The main screen of the mod (the one where you can select the packs) have been remade
      to be a proper list, and now has the packs icons displaying next to them
